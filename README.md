# QSerial 
##  This is a GPS interface written in Qt 5.4.0.  Will work in Linux, and in Windows.  Windows version will not create an executable.  
###  To run, connect GPS device (USB, or RS-232) prior to starting program.  This will allow the program to find USB and rs232 devices.  select Port, and baud rate.  The default baud rate is set to 9600.  
###  Functions not implemented yet.  Graphical satellite view in extended view, and the save data function.  Work in Progress ... (sort of).   --  Enjoy !  :)
